    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The district comprises of 15 schools with an overall student population of 39,170. The combined budget for these schools amounts to $24,649,428. When examining the average performance of students across the district, we find an average math score of 78.99 and an average reading score of 81.88.\n",
    "\n",
    "School Performance Highlights\n",
    "Top Performing Schools:\n",
    "Cabrera High School: With an impressive overall passing rate of 91.33%, Cabrera High School leads the district.\n",
    "Thomas High School: Close behind is Thomas High School with an overall passing rate of 90.95%.\n",
    "Griffin High School: Griffin High School boasts an overall passing rate of 90.60%.\n",
    "Wilson High School: Wilson High School also stands out with an overall passing rate of 90.58%.\n",
    "Pena High School: Finally, Pena High School rounds off the top five with an overall passing rate of 90.54%.\n",
    "Bottom Performing Schools:\n",
    "Rodriguez High School: Struggling in performance, Rodriguez High School has an overall passing rate of 52.99%.\n",
    "Figueroa High School: Figueroa High School follows closely behind with an overall passing rate of 53.20%.\n",
    "Huang High School: Huang High School is also among the lower performers with an overall passing rate of 53.51%.\n",
    "Johnson High School: Johnson High School has an overall passing rate of 53.54%.\n",
    "Ford High School: Lastly, Ford High School is in the bottom five with an overall passing r\n",
    "ate of 54.29%.\n",
    "Analysis by School Spending\n",
    "Upon closer inspection of school spending per student, we observe that schools falling within the budget range of $630-645 per student show the highest overall passing rate at 65.97%. This suggests that while a higher budget allocation may not always guarantee better performance, schools within this range have found an effective balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact of School Size\n",
    "Considering the impact of school size, smaller schools with fewer than 1,000 students showcase significantly higher performance rates. These smaller schools boast an average overall passing rate of 89.88%, indicating that a more intimate learning environment may contribute positively to student outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "School Type Comparison\n",
    "Finally, when comparing school types, charter schools emerge as the clear winners in overall performance metrics. Charter schools demonstrate an outstanding overall passing rate of 90.43%, whereas district schools l- ag behind at 53.67%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insights\n",
    "Smaller student populations correlate with better overall performance.\n",
    "Charter schools consistently outperform district schools acrSchools within the $630-645 per student budget range display the highest overall passing rates.nniwithin the district.\n",
